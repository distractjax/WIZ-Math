# WIZ-Math Test-Prep

This is a tool that I built to help people (myself, mainly) to study for the
mathematics portion of the Graduate Readiness Exam!

## Release Notes

### Build v0.1

I'm currently working on the initial release. I have the program in a position that
I feel justifies a v0.1 release instead of just a prototype stage, but it's
still a ways away from what I want the final product to be.

### v0.1 features

* A curses-driven Terminal User Interface (TUI).
* A set of basic number operations that practice problems are procedurally
  generated for
* A sidebar menu for navigating between subject areas.
* An install script for the following platforms:
  * Mac
  * Linux

### v0.2 features

* A separated event loop and TUI window structure for navigating problems and
  answering them.
* A SQLite database that tracks which kinds of problems you struggle with.
* A Stats window that shows you your problem history, study history
  and recommended study plan.
* Refactoring the sidebar to enable randomized and structured practice
  for math concepts at different levels.
